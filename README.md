# Calorimetric-Efficiency-of-the-Thermoelectric-Peltier-Device
This experimentally based project dives into Peltier effect, a thermoelectric property where electromotive forces induce temperature differences. We are concerned with the efficiency of common devices and how they compare to theoretical expectations.
